#RESPONSE: Perceived resident ratings of Durham as a place to live (Q24)
  #Q24 has 10 parts, each a rating of 1-5, with 9 meaning N/A
    #thus we shall create a variable which is simply a total of this; if value of 9, change to zero; sum all values

#EXPLORE ASSOCIATION WITH: length of time residents have lived in Durham (Q27)
#ADJUST FOR:
              #resident's total annual household income (Q33)
                #this variable is ordinal
              #whether monthly housing costs (rent or mortgage) exceed 30% of the resident's monthly income (Q9.1)
                #this variable is binary
              #other variables (existing or derived)
